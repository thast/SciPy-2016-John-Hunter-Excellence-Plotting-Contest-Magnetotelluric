The magnetotelluric (MT) method is a widely used geophysical technique, in particular for
imaging geothermal systems, that is sensitive to Earth structures as shallow as tens of
meters to depths of hundreds of kilometers. The source energy is electromagnetic waves,
generated in the atmosphere by lightning strikes and interactions with solar wind and
Earth's magnetic field. These waves travel as plane waves through the atmosphere and
ground. The animation is built to visually explore the physics of wave propagation and
relate them to observed data. This enhances intuition and comprehension of the
equations and highlights the dynamic nature of the wave propagation, unlike the static
nature of data.

Electromagnetic waves are governed by Maxwell‚Äôs equations and hence are sensitive to
contrasts in physical properties that can be interpreted in terms of geologic structure and
fluid content. The diagnostic physical property for MT is electrical conductivity ùúé (or its
inverse resistivity ùúå). The impact of contrasts in dielectric permittivity ùúÄ and magnetic
permittivity ùúá is expected to be negligible.

Any wave that hits the Earth gets refracted vertically because of the extreme contrast in
conductivity, regardless of the angle of incidence. It is thus sufficient to model a vertically
propagating plane wave. For our modelling we assume a 1D layered Earth.

The panels of the figure allow us to break down the physics into simpler pieces. The
lower-right panel illustrates the reflection and transmission of the wave at interfaces. At
the Earth‚Äôs surface, most of the downward propagating wave is reflected while the
transmitted part diffuses downward. The upper-right panel shows the total (sum of their
up and down going) electric and magnetic fields. The depth of investigation is regulated
by a damping effect on the transmitted wave‚Äôs amplitude due to the increase of
